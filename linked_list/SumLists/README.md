#Question: Sum Lists

You have twonumbers represented by a Linked List, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that 1's digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a Linked List.

Example: (7 -> 1 -> 6) + (5 -> 9 -> 2). That is, 617 + 295.

Output: 2 -> 1 -> 9. That is 912.
