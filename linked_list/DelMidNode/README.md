#Question: Delete Middle Node

Implement an algorithm to delete a node int the middle (i.e., any node but the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) of a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Example
Input: the node c from the Linked List a -> b -> c -> d -> e -> f
Result: nothing is returned but the new linked list looks like a -> b -> d -> e -> f
